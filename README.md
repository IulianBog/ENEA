Problems in program functionality


1. I had some problems with accesing the any channel apart of channel 1 (microphone). So to fix this I download a Virtual Cable (https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/download.htm) and link the output (speakers) with the input (microphone).  

2. The video recording does not exceed 13FPS (I think) . Thus the video recording will be very fast because the screenshots are much too rare.

3. To get rid of the ads I installed an ad-blocker.Thus, if you do not have such a program or something similar, an error will appear in the "open_youtube" file.
